# **sysopctl Command Overview**
The `sysopctl` command is a custom Linux tool designed for system administration. It provides a suite of operations to manage system services, processes, disk usage, system load, logs, and backups. The command can be invoked with different options and parameters to execute various administrative tasks on a Linux machine. Below is a structured solution for the task, including the basic functionality and the advanced features.

This script, `sysopctl`, is a command-line tool for managing system tasks. It supports commands like:

- `service` (manage system services)
- `system load` (display system load)
- `disk usage` (show disk usage)
- `process monitor` (monitor system processes)
- `logs analyze` (view critical logs)
- `backup` (backup files)

The script processes user input, executing relevant functions using commands like `systemctl`, `df`, `top`, `journalctl`, and `rsync`. The `--help` and `--version` options provide usage info.
